Libraries Pagination Class  Libraries Parser Class  Libraries Code\-Igniter Profiler Class This class enables you to display benchmark, query, and other data in order to help with debugging and optimization. Note\-: At some point it would be good to move all the H\-T\-M\-L in this class into a set of template files in order to allow customization.  Libraries Session Class  Libraries S\-H\-A1 Encoding Class Purpose\-: Provides 160 bit hashing using The Secure Hash Algorithm developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The 40 character S\-H\-A1 message hash is computationally infeasible to crack. This class is a fallback for servers that are not running P\-H\-P greater than 4.\-3, or do not have the M\-H\-A\-S\-H library. This class is based on two scripts\-: Marcus Campbell's P\-H\-P implementation (G\-N\-U license) {\tt http\-://www.\-tecknik.\-net/sha-\/1/} ...which is based on Paul Johnston's Java\-Script version (B\-S\-D license). {\tt http\-://pajhome.\-org.\-uk/} I encapsulated the functions and wrote one additional method to fix a hex conversion bug. -\/ Rick Ellis  Libraries Code\-Igniter An open source application development framework for P\-H\-P 5.\-1.\-6 or newer  Expression\-Engine Dev Team  Copyright (c) 2008 -\/ 2011, Ellis\-Lab, Inc.  {\tt http\-://codeigniter.\-com/user\-\_\-guide/license.\-html}  {\tt http\-://codeigniter.\-com}  Version 1.\-3.\-1  H\-T\-M\-L Table Generating Class Lets you create tables manually or from database result objects, or arrays.
